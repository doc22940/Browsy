# Browsy
A Mac OS utility that allows to choose with which browser to open a hyperlink.

## Usage
Browsy must be set as the default web browser from system preferences. This will start it whenever a hyperlink is clicked and will show a list of installed browsers, clicking on a browser from the list will open the hyperlink in that browser. That's it.

## Disclaimer
This app has been written in a quick and dirty way out of the necessity for such a utility. Unfortunately I'm not an experienced Mac OS developer so there's still much that can be improved in it. I hope you'll find it useful though: pull requests are welcome!
